        Let Us Tell Your Story
    </h2>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        The way this crazy life works, moments flash forward. They're beautiful, and there is so much to celebrate.<br> I love capturing those
        moments you're proud of. Whether you're saying "I do", or building your family, showcasing that is my specialty.

    <p>I specialize in a film look & lifestyle feel, full of light and love. I graduated with my bachelors in videography, and currently work
        doing corporate videography for an incredible company. But my passion is for these moments. Capturing weddings, engagements, births, and
        lifestyle sessions are my thing. Because it's when people are celebrating what they love. And I feel lucky enough to capture it.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Where to even start with Celine’s expertise? Everyday of the week, I would recommend her to shoot your
        wedding. She can shoot at any time of day, is direct in her instructions, and produces quality photos. She’s everything you’d want in a
        photographer— she helps you feel comfortable and natural while posing, positions you when you don’t know what to do, and makes you feel 
        like the most beautiful person during all of it. I felt absolutely confident in Celine shooting my wedding and bridals and am more than 
        joyful with the results.”</p>
