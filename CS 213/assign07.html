                <h3>WELCOME FROM PRESIDENT VICTORIA GROSS</h3>
                <p id="welcome-letter">
                    Welcome to Monsters University, one of the great institutions of learning in the world. Our advancements in the academic fields of Scaring, Science, Engineering, and Business are, of course, now legendary. And the range of disciplines and their interrelationships throughout our campus has created a unique mix of intellectual and cultural perspectives, perspectives that not only define us, but drive us to be better. At MU we also dedicate ourselves to ethical and responsible uses of financial, physical, and environmental resources. We continually remind ourselves to care for the fragile tapestry of our environment and to temper our needs for power with our desire to make our world a more sustainable place for all our future generations. <br><br>What really makes us special, what makes us unique, are the diverse groups of monsters that teach and learn in the halls of our beautiful campus. Monsters of all varieties, from the wide-eyed freshman just cutting his fangs to the seasoned post-grad student, create a diversity of culture that makes MU one of the most unique educational environments in the world. <br><br> We are a place where learning is fluid and ever-changing, where the river of knowledge pushes us in unconventional and unexpected directions. Yet, we also remain anchored by the centuries of traditions that have proved essential in developing our academic foundations. I am proud to belong to an academic community that continually pushes its students towards excellence, a community that is not content to rest on its past accomplishments but is ever looking forward to a future of new designs and possibilities.<br><br> Sincerely,<br><br> President Victoria Gross

                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p class="text">

                    Established in 1313 following a land grant from the city of Monstropolis, Monsters University has grown from a small local center of learning to a leading global institution of higher education. Upon this hallowed ground, some of the most fabled academic buildings in the world have been built, serving the hundreds of thousands of alumni that have walked the halls and grounds of MU.
                </p>

                <h3>Founder's Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    University founder Arthur Clawson's words ring as true today as they did that blustery day in 1313: "Knowledge must never be feared, wisdom must always be pursued, and excellence must be at the center of everything."
